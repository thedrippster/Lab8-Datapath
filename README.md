In this lab, we created a datapath for a processor which uses RISC-V ISA for R, I, S, and B type instruction. 

Blocks include: Program Counter, 2 Adders (+4, +offset), Read-Only Memory, Instruction Decoder, Immediate Generator, Register File, Arithmetic Logic Unit, 
Random Access Memory, and 3 Multiplexors
